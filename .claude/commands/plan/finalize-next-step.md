We just finished to implement the next project iteration.
We now need to verify the changes and commit them to git if all seems OK.

1. Read the following specs to get the general project context
- Read aidocs/04 Technische Spezifikation.md
- Read aidocs/03 Erster Implementierungsplan.md
- Read aidocs/05 Implementation History.md

2. Read the description of the task that was just implemented.
- Read aidocs/6 Next step.md

3. Find all uncomitted code changes using git

4. Verify that the step was properly implemented

5. Run all unit tests and ensure that they pass

6. Update aidocs/05 Implementation History.md. Add a section for this iteration

7. commit all changes to the current branch using a multiline commit message that summarizes the changes.
