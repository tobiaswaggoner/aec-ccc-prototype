We want to continue to implement the next iteration in our plan.
First we need to find what is to be done next and create a detailed plan for this iteration.

1. Read the following specs:
- Read aidocs/04 Technische Spezifikation.md
- Read aidocs/03 Erster Implementierungsplan.md
- Read aidocs/05 Implementation History.md

2. Find the next thing to implement
Identify the next Iteration to implement taking into account the Implementierungsplan and the Implementation History.

3. Create an implementation plan
Delete the file 'aidocs/06 Next step.md' if it exists.
Create a file aidocs/06 Next step.md
Create a detailed step by step implementation plan for the next iteration. Always include steps for creating and running unit tests. The plan should have the following format:

# Next Step: Iteration ... - {Short description}
